## Hi there üëã

I studied Computer Engineering and Computer Science at UW Madison ü¶°üî¥ and recently
completed my Masters degree in Computer Science at the University of Texas at
Austin! üêÇü§ò

I have several interests, but most tie back to High Performance Computing and trying
to make things faster!


The classes and concepts I have most enjoyed in school and work are:
- **Systems Programming** - Operating systems and virtualization
- **Parallel Computing** - High-performance computing, CUDA, and distributed systems
- **Machine Learning** - Deep learning, NLP, Machine Learning and Optimization 
- **Distributed Systems** - Consensus algorithms and concurrent programming
- **Mathematics** - Algorithms, linear algebra and optimization

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills

Experience varies, but...

**Programming Languages:**
- **C/C++** - Systems programming, CUDA, OpenMP, MPI
- **Python** - Machine learning, data analysis, scripting
- **Rust** - Systems programming, distributed algorithms
- **Go** - Concurrent programming, systems development

**Technologies & Tools:**
- **Systems:** Docker, virtualization, file systems, memory management
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, deep learning frameworks
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Development:** Linux, shell scripting
